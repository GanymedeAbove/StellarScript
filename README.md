StellarScript: Advanced Astrological Computation through the Command Line
StellarScript is a powerful and innovative command-line tool designed for astrologers, astronomers, and astrology enthusiasts who require precise and in-depth astrological computations. This tool leverages the renowned capabilities of the Swiss Ephemeris to provide accurate and extensive astrological data, catering to both professional astrological practice and personal interest.

Key Features:
Planetary Position Calculation: Determines the exact geocentric and heliocentric positions of all major celestial bodies—including the planets, the Sun, the Moon, and key asteroids—along with their longitudinal positions in various zodiac signs.
House System Analysis: Offers detailed calculations of astrological houses using multiple house systems, including Placidus, Koch, and Whole Sign, among others, allowing users to customize the framework according to their astrological methodologies.
Aspect Identification: Identifies major and minor aspects between celestial bodies, providing insights into the dynamic interactions that influence individual charts.
Retrogradation and Direct Motion Analysis: Detects and reports the retrograde and direct motions of planets, crucial for interpreting their astrological influence.
Natal Chart Creation: Generates comprehensive natal charts based on date, time, and location of birth, offering a snapshot of the heavens at the moment of birth.
Transit and Progression Reports: Calculates transits and progressions over specific dates, providing foresight into future influences and trends.
Interpretative Insights: Although primarily focused on data computation, future versions aim to integrate interpretative texts for planetary positions, house placements, and aspects, making the readings more accessible to users without deep astrological knowledge.
Usability:
StellarScript is designed with user-friendliness in mind, suitable for users who are comfortable with basic command-line operations. It aims to simplify the process of obtaining detailed astrological data without the need for sophisticated software, making it accessible from any system that supports a command line.

Future Enhancements:
Graphical Representations: Plans to include ASCII or simple graphical representations of charts directly in the command line.
Interactive Mode: A more interactive command-line interface that will guide users through input and offer more direct control over the types of calculations performed.
Extended Interpretations: Expanding the scope of textual interpretations and integrating them with cultural, historical, and psychological insights into astrology.
StellarScript is ideal for professional astrologers requiring detailed calculations, astrology students seeking to understand the mechanics behind the charts, and technology enthusiasts interested in the intersection of computation and ancient science. As an open-source project, it invites collaboration and innovation, continually adapting and expanding to meet the diverse needs of its users.
