StellarScript To-Do List
Setup and Initial Testing
 Review Installation: Ensure that the Bash script installs all dependencies correctly on a fresh system.
 Run Initial Tests: Test the Python script to confirm it calculates planetary positions accurately.
 Validate Outputs: Cross-reference outputs with known astrological data to ensure accuracy.
Development Enhancements
 Expand Script Features: Consider adding calculations for additional astrological points or aspects.
 Refine Output Formatting: Improve how the outputs are displayed in the console to make them easier to read and understand.
 Script Optimization: Look for any opportunities to optimize or refactor the script for better performance or clarity.
Learning and Documentation
 Study Astrological Computations: Continue learning about astrological calculations to enhance your understanding and possibly the script’s capabilities.
 Document Personal Findings: Keep notes on any interesting findings or challenges you encounter while using the script for your personal astrology studies.
 Update README for Personal Use: Ensure the README contains all the information you need to remember how to use and modify the script.
Backup and Version Control
 Regular Commits: Make it a habit to commit changes regularly to your Git repository, even if it’s just for personal tracking.
 Backup Important Data: Ensure you have backups of your scripts and any important data they generate, perhaps using cloud storage or an external drive.
Future Exploration
 Experiment with Additional Libraries: If interested, explore other Python libraries that might enhance the script's capabilities or add new features.
 Consider GUI Options: For a more interactive personal use, consider experimenting with a simple GUI framework like Tkinter.
Maintenance
 Regular Updates: Regularly update the dependencies and Python itself to keep the software environment current and secure.
 Review and Tidy Code: Periodically review the code to tidy up and remove any unused parts or comments that are no longer needed.
Personal Growth
 Reflect on Learnings: Periodically reflect on what you have learned from working on this project and how it has contributed to your personal and technical growth.
 Plan Next Steps: Depending on your evolving interests, plan future projects or extensions of this one.
